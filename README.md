# What to do when aws cli doesn't install due to permissions
Symptom
```
I'm having issues upgrading awscli, anyone run into this before?
pip install awscli --user --upgrade
...
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/david/.local/lib/python2.7'
You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 18.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```
Solution
<pre>
Try running `sudo chown -R david:david /home/david/.local`. This should reset the ownership back to your account for everything. Nothing in `.local` should be owned by the root user/group.

Also, make sure you don't run pip with `sudo` or else it will probably change ownership back to `root`. 
If everything's going into `.local`, you can just run it as your account.

# How to find large files
<pre>
See disk utilization
$ df

Start from root directory and issue:
$ sudo du -sh *

Another good place to start is the /var directory (if this is a Confluence/JIRA server)

Change into suspect directory and repeat command until you find source of large files.

# Common reasons for disk utilization on Confluence/JIRA exceeding 75%
1) /var/atlassian/application-data/confluence/backups  (local backups enabled - default behavior unless manually disabled)
2) /opt/atlassian/confluence/logs/catalina.out         (file not rotated regularly)
